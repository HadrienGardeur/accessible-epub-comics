	  <p id="page2-panel2-description">Surrounded by dark clouds, Pepper floats on her broom, turning back towards Carrot who's hanging from her backpack.</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel2-bubble1">Pepper says: "Alright then, off to the land of the setting moons. Shichimi can tell us how to join the witches of Ah."</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel2-bubble2">"Carrot, get out the map and compass: it's too cloudy to see where I'm going"</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel3-description">Mouth wide-opened, Carrot opens the backpack, grabs the map with his left paw and the compass with his right paw.</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel4-description">>Pepper looses control over her broom and as they both dive down, the content of her backpack is lost in the sky.</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel4-bubble">Pepper shouts: "DRATS! Turbulence! HOLD ON!"</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel5-description">A dark tornado lies in front of them, as thunder strikes mere meters away from the broom.</p>
	  <p id="page2-panel5-bubble">Pepper shouts: "Oh no!!!"</p>
