	  <p id="page6-panel1-description">In a different land, Pepper and Carrot arrive at a crossroad in the middle of the night. With eight different potential directions, Pepper points towards one of them.</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel2-description">Pepper stares into a brightly lit sky full of stars.</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel3-description">Pepper and Carrot are both holding walking sticks. From the look of Pepper's hair and clothes, the toil of their trip can be seen. Pepper makes her best impression of something that Thyme would typically say.</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel3-bubble1">Pepper does her best impression of Thyme to say: "A true witch of Chaosah needs neither compass nor map. A starry sky will suffice"</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel3-bubble2">Pepper says: "… I would've preferred a real course in divination!"</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel4-description1">In a land where three moons can be seen in the sky, Pepper drops her walking stick and points excitedly in front of her, waving hello with her other hand.</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel4-bubble">Pepper says: "Cheer up Carrot! Look, we've arrived!"</p>
	  <p id="page6-panel4-description2">Shichimi waves back with both hands. In the background, we can see temples half hanging in the sky, with waterfalls dropping from these pieces of land.</p>
