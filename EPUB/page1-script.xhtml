  	<p id="page1-panel1-description">Pepper walks away from the house of the witches of Chaosah with a heavy backpack on her shoulders and Carrot attached to her leg. In the background, the three witches are standing on the front porch, looking sadly at Pepper.</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel2-description">Cumin looks sadder than the rest of the witches and shakily addresses Pepper.</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel2-bubble">Cumin says: "But Pepper… Come back…"</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel3-description">Pepper frowns and looks angrily over her shoulder.</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel3-bubble1">Pepper shouts: "NO! I'M LEAVING!!"</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel3-bubble2">Pepper says: "You don't teach real witchcraft! I'm going - to the witches of Ah!"</p>
	  <p id="page1-panel4-description">Pepper and Carrot fly away from the house on Pepper's broom, making a woosh sound as it reaches dark clouds in the sky.</p>
